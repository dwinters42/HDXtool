This little program semi-automatically fits the exact position and
abundance of peaks belonging to the same fragment in e.g. top-down MS
spectra of proteins and can be used for a variety of other purposes,
like extracting exact centroid masses for Hydrogen-Deuterium-Exchange
(HDX) experiments.

<h1>Installation</h1>

Prerequisites: You will need the [https://www.python.org|Python
interpreter] and the following Python modules:

  *   [http://pyyaml.org/|py-yaml]
  *   [www.wxpython.org|wxPython]
  *   [http://matplotlib.org/|matplotlib]
  *   [http://www.scipy.org|SciPy]

After having these installed, just run the HDXtool.py script.

<h1>Usage</h1>

The workflow is like this:

  #  Load a datafile containing comma separated XY mass spectrum,
     e.g. like the included "test.dat" (which is an oversimplified
     example). This loads the file and pops up a window showing the
     spectrum.
  #  Next, press the "Region Of Interest" (ROI) button and click on
     three points in the spectrum plot to define the baseline
     (everything over the baseline will be searched for peaks), the
     left boundary for the search and finally the right boundary of
     the fragment you want to work on. You will get three lines in the
     spectrum plot.
  #  Press "Suggest" and then click on the highest peak in the fragment
     series, which will be fitted and the fit will show in a new
     window.
  #  Click on the next peak to the right or left of the main peak, which
     will be fitted again.
  #  The program will now try to find all peaks belonging to the
     fragment, fit them and mark the position in the spectrum
     plot. Finally, it will show the fitted curves in a new window.
  #  If you like the fit, press "Accept" and the peaks will be memorized
     by the program. A line in the main window shows the centroid mass
     and position and charge state.
  #  By right-clicking on a line you can delete a fragment, add a
     comment or copy the selection to the clipboard for e.g. pasting
     into Excel.
  #  Finally, pressing the "Save button" will generate a text file in
     YAML format with all the fitdata. The next time the data file is
     openend, the fitdata is imported as well.

<h1>Data format</h1>

The fitdata is saved in a special text format called YAML that is
human-friendly and contains the fitted data for all fragements:

  *   lower boundary ("low")
  *   high boundary ("high")
  *   Baseline ("thres") 
  *   Centroid mass ("centroid")
  *   Charge state ("charge state")
  *   the actual peak fitdata ("peaks")
