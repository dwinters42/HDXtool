#+TITLE: HDXtool.py: peak extraction from Mass Spectra

This little program semi-automatically fits the exact position and
abundance of peaks belonging to the same fragment in e.g. top-down MS
spectra of proteins and can be used for a variety of other purposes,
like extracting exact centroid masses for Hydrogen-Deuterium-Exchange
(HDX) experiments.
